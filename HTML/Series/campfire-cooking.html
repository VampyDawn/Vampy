                    <p class="synopsis">Mukouda Tsuyoshi was nothing special in modern Japan, so when he was summoned to a world of 
                        swordplay and sorcery, he thought he was ready for the adventure of a lifetime. Too bad the kingdom that 
                        summoned him only got him by mistake! Not only was he not one of the three summoned heroes, but his stats were 
                        laughable compared to theirs. On top of that, there's something really sketchy about this kingdom... "Ah, these 
                        people are the kind to try and use the Hero," he realized, and immediately left to make his own way in this 
                        other world. The only thing Mukouda can rely on is his unique skill: the "Online Supermarket," a skill that 
                        allows him to buy modern goods in a fantasy world. It's useless for combat, but if he plays his cards right, he 
                        could lead a comfortable life, maybe? At least, that's what Mukouda thinks, but it turns out modern food bought 
                        with this skill has some absurd effects! What happens when Mukouda introduces ridiculously tasty modern cooking 
                        to a fantasy world like this? He gets some ridiculous repeat customers begging for more...!</p>
